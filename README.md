# Neural handwriting analyzer
The project is an application for recognizing digits written in a dialog box with a computer mouse.

## General info
The project consists of two parts. The first part is a model of convolutional neural network trained with a data from 
'data.zip' folder. Firstly unpack the folder and then run the program to train the network. The second part is an 
application that allows you to draw digits. To start entering digits, run the program and press the 'Start' button. 
Draw a digit in the white field and press the 'Recognize' button to recognize the digit. The recognized digit will be 
displayed on the right. Press the 'Clear' button to clear the field and start over.
